In recent years neuromorphic computing has  become  an 
important emerging research area. There has been rapid 
progress  in  computational  theory,  learning  algorithms, 
signal processing and circuit design and implementation, 
which  have  shown  appealing  computational  advantages 
over  conventional  solutions.  The  low  size,  weight,  and 
power  of  these  hardware  architectures  shows  great 
potential for embedded cognitive systems.  Starting from 
emulating the computational principles and architecture 
found in neural systems, neuromorphic computing  aims 
to  integrate  sensory  coding,  synaptic  computing  (e.g., 
STDP),  learning  and  memory,  and  attempts  to  develop 
neuromorphic sensors and chips, and cognitive behaving 
systems  such  as  robots.  Neuromorphic  hardware  has 
provided  a  fundamentally  different  technique  for  data 
representation  and  learning,  e.g.,  asynchronous  events 
rather than regularly sampled frames of images. Various 
hardware  systems  leveraging  on  neural  spikes  based 
computing  have  been  reported  to  achieve  good 
performance  with  much  lower  power  consumption. 
Therefore,  neuromorphic  computing  can  inform 
cognitive systems because the algorithms that run on this 
hardware  must  be  neurobiologically  inspired.  A  huge 
potential  exists  for  applying  this  emerging  computing 
framework  to  the  next  generation  of  cognitive  systems 
and robotics, neuro-inspired sensors and processors, etc.
