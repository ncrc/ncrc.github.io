              <div class="am-list-item-text2"><b>Talk: </b>State-of-the art Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithms </div>
              <div class="am-list-item-text2"><b>Abstract:</b> 
Evolutionary computation is the study of biologically motivated computational paradigms which exert novel ideas and inspiration from natural evolution and adaptation.  The applications of population-based heuristics in solving multiobjective optimization problems have been receiving a growing attention.  To search for a family of Pareto optimal solutions based on nature-inspiring problem solving paradigms, Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Algorithms have been successfully exploited to solve optimization problems in which the fitness measures and even constraints are uncertain and changed over time. When encounter optimization problems with many objectives, nearly all designs performs poorly because of loss of selection pressure in fitness evaluation solely based upon Pareto optimality principle.  This talk will survey recently published literature along this line of research- evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization and its real-world applications.  Based on performance metrics ensemble, we will provide a comprehensive measure among all competitors and more importantly reveal insight pertaining to specific problem characteristics that the underlying evolutionary algorithm could perform the best. The experimental results confirm the finding from the No Free Lunch theorem: any algorithm’s elevated performance over one class of problems is exactly paid for in loss over another class.

              <div class="am-list-item-text2"><b>Abstract:</b> 
               Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) enhances the capability of a human  brain in communicating and interacting with the environment directly. BCI plays an important role in natural cognition, which concerns the studies of brain and behavior at work for enhancing or restoring cognitive functions. Many people may benefit from BCI, which facilitates continuous monitoring of fluctuations in cognitive states  under monotonous conditions in workplace or at home.People who suffer from episodic or progressive cognitive impairments in daily life can also benefit from  BCI. In this talk, I will first introduce the current status of BCI and its major  obstacles: lack of wearable EEG devices, various forms of noise contamination,  user/circadian variability, and lack of suitable adaptive cognitive modeling. I will then  introduce some methodologies to overcome these obstacles, including discovering  the fundamental physiological changes of human cognitive functions at work and then utilizing these main bio-findings and computational intelligence (CI) techniques to monitor, maintain, or track human cognitive states and operating performance. In  the second part of my presentation, I will introduce an innovative BCI-inspired  research domain called Cyber-Brain-Physical Systems. Some future research  directions in this domain will be explored and discussed, including BCI-embedded  wearable computing, BCI-based neuro-prosthesis and assistive devices, wearable cognitive robots, and BCI-empowered training.The potential real-life applications of  BCI on various aspects of training/education, healthcare, rehabilitation, and medical treatment will also be introduced and discussed.

              <div class="am-list-item-text2"><b>Abstract:</b>Data-driven decision-making and optimization is becoming increasingly important in industry. In this talk, we will discuss two typical challenges arising in data-driven optimization, namely big data and sparse data. In the former situation, the available data is subject to various amount of uncertainty and the volume of data is huge, while in the latter case, only little data is available for making decisions. Techniques for handing Big Data and sparse data will then be presented to address the above mentioned challenges illustrated by real-world optimization examples.</div>

              <div class="am-list-item-text2"><b>Talk: </b>Imbalanced Learning in Big Data</div>
              <div class="am-list-item-text2"><b>Abstract:</b>Big data has become an important topic worldwide over the past several years. Among many aspects of the big data research and development, imbalanced learning has become a critical component as many data sets in real-world applications are imbalanced, ranging from surveillance, security, Internet, finance, social network, to medical and healthy related data analysis. In general, the imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews, which is a typical case for many of the medical diagnosis data analysis, such as cancerous classification. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently and effectively into information and knowledge representation. <br>
In this talk, I will start with an overview of the nature and foundation of the imbalanced learning, and then focus on the state-of-the-art methods and technologies in dealing with the imbalanced data, followed by a systematic discussion on the assessment metrics to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. I will also present the latest research development in our group that we have developed and tested on various imbalanced data sets. Finally, as a relatively new challenge to the community, I will highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data facing the big data era.</div>

              <div class="am-list-item-text2"><b>Talk: </b>Towards the Convergence of Machine and Biological Intelligence</div>
              <div class="am-list-item-text2"><b>Abstract:</b>Recent advances in the multidisciplinary fields such as brain-machine interfaces, artificial intelligence, and computational neuroscience, signal a growing convergence between machines and living beings. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) enable direct communication pathways between the brain and an external device, making it possible to connect organic and computing parts at the signal level. Cyborg means a biological-machine system consisting of both organic and computing components. Cyborg intelligence aims to deeply integrate machine intelligence with biological intelligence by connecting machines and living beings via BMIs, enhancing strengths and compensating for weaknesses by combining the biological cognition capability with the machine computational capability. This talk will introduce the concept, architectures, and applications of cyborg intelligence.</div>

              <div class="am-list-item-text2"><b>Abstract:</b>Statistical similarity measures play significant roles in machine learning and signal processing . Recently, some novel similarity measures were proposed, which are defined as a certain distance in a kernel space. Typical examples include the Information Potential (IP), Cross Information Potential (CIP), Cauchy-Schwartz Divergence, Correntropy, and so on. In particular, the Correntropy as a nonlinear and local similarity measure is directly related to the probability of how similar two random variables are in a neighborhood of the joint space, controlled by the kernel bandwidth, which also has its root in Renyi's entropy (hence the name “Correntropy"). Since Correntropy (especially with a small kernel bandwidth) is insensitive to outliers, it is naturally a robust cost for machine learning. The Correntropy Induced Metric (CIM) as a nice approximation of the l0 norm can also be used as a sparsity penalty in sparse learning. This talk will give an overview of several similarity measures in kernel space, with a particular emphasis on Correntropy. The applications to robust regression, adaptive filtering, principal components analysis (PCA), deep learning and causality detection, will also be discussed. </div>
